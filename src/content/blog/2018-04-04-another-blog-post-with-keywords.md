It's time I wrote a real blog post, so here it is. I recently did a complete website overhaul, moving from a LAMP stack + Wordpress to a JAM stack + Gatsby. I've been hearing a whole lot about Gatsby, GraphQL, and Netlify lately, so this past weekend I decided to give it a whirl.

First thing, I was amazed at how easy it was to get up and running. Part of that could be my level of experience compared to what it was when I last attempted working with a static site generator. But most of the reason is the really well written tutorials and starter kits provided by the community.

For those who are not familiar with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), it is a static site generator that uses a React component system to build elements of your website. Static site generators are usually a tool that takes in templates, assets, and data, and builds a folder of more folders & files that, when hosted, is a website. The benefit of these generators is mostly performance, by removing the need for a framework like Wordpress or Drupal you skip a bunch of unnecessary steps including querying a database. That, combined with the power of a single page application built with React, and you get an incredibly fast website.

For hosting I decided to terminate my AWS EC2 instance and test out [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Configuring my free Netlify account to deploy from a Github repo was super simple, it auto detected Gatsby and setup the build commands itself. Now, whenever I push to the master branch of that repo Netlify will detect that new commit and compile the new code for deployment. So I've got a free hosting option, much better than the $10/mo for a micro EC2 running a bunch of stuff I don't need.

There is most definitely the time and place for a PHP framework like Wordpress or Drupal, my personal website just is not the place for it.

So Gatsby lets you add new content nodes to your website a multitude of ways, I started by creating my blog posts as markdown files in a content folder through my text editor. This works great for developers, but I needed a solution for if I ever build a website for a client and they need to manage the content themselves. Plus, I'm a front-end developer so I need a good UI to look at for inspiration ðŸ˜Ž. In comes [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), a _CMS for static site generators. _

Netlify CMS is an open-source project looking to provide an admin portal on your static website through which editors can manage the content. After a bit of tinkering I was able to set this up using the free services provided by Netlify. In short, the CMS updates content through merge requests on Github, that way when the content is "publish" and the merge request is accepted, Netlify will then compile you website and publish the new content to production.
